TASK 19 - Epic
- Perform quality metric calculations for defect density of a system Defect Density and SSI
- Use the Musa Logarithmic model to calculate failure intensity and the number of expected failures



TASK 20 - User Stories

User Story 1: Quality Metric Calculations for Defect Density and SSI

As a system quality engineer,
I want to calculate defect density and the total number of Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) for successive releases starting from the second release,
So that I can assess code quality and track codebase changes over time.

User Story 2: Musa Logarithmic Model for Failure Intensity and Expected Failures

As a system quality engineer,
I want to calculate the failure intensity an the number of expected failures of the system using the Musa Logarithmic model,
So that I can predict the systemâ€™s reliability over time.
